# Welcome to Go!

This document/repo contains all the goodness we need to run our "learn Go" lunch-and-learn.
We eat, we learn, we Go.

## Pre-Req to Lunch and Learn

  - [Install Go](./install_go.md) *or* use the [Playground](https://play.golang.org)
  - Order tasty lunch!

## Language Overview

Before we dive into code, let's do a short, high-level overview of the language and some of it's
important features and/or characteristics.

  - C style, systems programming language
  - Go is kinda-sort OOP, but not really and people will tell you it's not
  - source builds (no linking), generates a static binary
  - compiled to machine code
  - garbage collected
    - no differentiation of heap vs stack
  - runtime, but no virtual machine or dependencies
  - green thread, CSP style concurrency
    - diagram CSP and channels
  - typed, type inference

## Learn Ya'll Some Go

Our goal is to make it as far down this list as possible.

  - `01.` [Speed Tour](./speed_tour.md)
  - `02.` [Hello World](./hello_world.md)
  - `03.` [Ping Pong]
  - `04.` [Web Server]
  - `05.` [Delve](./delve_debugging.md)
